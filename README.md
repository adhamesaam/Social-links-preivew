## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I have learned more about the peusdo classes and how to make elements interactive with the user, also learned more about how to control a picture and how to move it around on the page

```css
.social_links:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will focus more on making the pages more interactive with the user and add some animation

### Useful resources

- [CSS psuedo elements](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand pseudo elements and how to add it in your code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
